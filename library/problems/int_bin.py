"""Problem definition

Description: The IntBin problem consists of finding the integer
with greatest number of 1's in its binary representation

Search space: Integers from 1 to 15.

Representation: Binary string representing the integer.

Fitness function: f(x)= Number of 1's in binary representation of x

Neighbors: Each binary representation of an integer x has as neighbors any other binary with a bit flipped.

Goal: Maximize f(x).
