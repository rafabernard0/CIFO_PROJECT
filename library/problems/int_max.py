"""Problem definition

Description: The IntMax problem consists of finding the biggest integer between 1 and some N

Search space: Integers from 1 to 15.

Fitness function: f(x)=x (i.e., the number itself).

Neighbors: Each integer x has at most two neighbors: x-1 and x+1, except for boundaries (1 and 15).

Goal: Maximize f(x).
